1. Compute response time and turnaround time when running three jobs of length 200 with SJF and FIFO
FIFO -
Resp: 
	Job 0: 0
	Job 1: 200
	Job 2: 400
Turnaround time:
	Job 0: 200
	Job 1: 400
	Job 2: 600

SJF -
Turnaround and response times are the exact same
regardless of if we use SJF or FIFO because all three jobs
run for the same amount of time. If one of the tasks took
slightly longer, then it would be the last task to run if we used the SJF
scheduling algorithm.

2. Do the same with 100, 200, 300 respectively.

FIFO -
Resp:
	Job 0: 0
	Job 1: 100
	Job 2: 300
Turnaround time:
	Job 0: 100
	Job 1: 300
	Job 2: 600
They could have arrived in any order for FIFO. The response & turnaround times would be different if
they arrived in a different order.

SJF -
Resp:
	Job 0: 0
	Job 1: 100
	Job 2: 300
Turnaround time:
	Job 0: 100
	Job 1: 300
	Job 2: 600
This is the only set of response/turnaround times that the jobs can
have if they were to run with the SJF algorithm. This is because the shortest
jobs must run first


3. Do the same but with RR scheduler and time-slice of 1
Resp:
	Job 0: 0
	Job 1: 1
	Job 2: 2
Turnaround time:
	Job 0: 558
	Job 1: 559
	Job 2: 600

4. When all the jobs have the same runtime.
5. All jobs have the same runtime and the quantum length is the same as the runtime of each job.
6. As job lengths increase, the response time goes up. 
7. The response time goes up because when the quantum length goes up, the first job can run for a little longer
so time at which the second job starts running gets pushed back which then takes place for the third job.
