1. CPU utilization is the sum of work handled by a Central Processing Unit. Computer's usage of processing resources. The CPU utilization should e 100% since the chances that each instruction is a CPU instruction is 100% and both processes have 100.

2. Takes around 11 time units.

3. Takes around 7 time units. Switching the order matters because we can start the process that makes an IO request and while it waits, the other process can execute.

4. It will take the same amount of time as running the 4:100 process first because the flag blocks the other process from executing until the I/O result comes back.

5. 7 time units.

6. The first IO instruction is waiting, then another process executes, then the first process with the three IO instructions executes. This is ineffective because the first process didn't finish.

7. This behavior is different because it runs faster.
