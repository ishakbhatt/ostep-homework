Homework (Measurement): Write code to measure OS or hardware performance
measure costs of a system call and context switch. 
How to measure cost of system call:
- repeatedly call simple system call
- time how long it takes
- divide time by number of iterations

typical timer to use: gettimeofday()
- return time in microseconds since 1970
- not precise, so use rdtsc on x86 machines

how to measure cost of context switch:
- run two processes on a single cpu
- set up Unix two pipes between them
- pipe is a way to communicate between processes:
	- first process issues write to the first pipe & waits for read from second pipe
	- OS puts first process in blocked state & switches to other proc
	- second proc reads from first pipe and writes to second
	- second proc gets blocked and context switches back
- context switches measured with pipes & processes
- on systems with more than one CPU: use sched_setaffinity() to bind process to particular processor
